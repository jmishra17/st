    <string name ="aboutUs">
        Space Trooper is a small 2D game engine, developed by 
        Jasper Bloom, an undergraduate student at the University 
        of Washington. Right now it is only available in 3 levels
        but if you feel satisfied with this old school styled of 
        game, shoot an email at jbloom1704@gmail.com and I will add
        more levels and features. Thank you for playing Space 
        Trooper. Your feed back is important.
